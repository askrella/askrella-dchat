# Askrella Decentralized Chat

This is a decentralized end-to-end encrypted chat application built using GunDB. GunDB is a distributed graph database that provides real-time, offline-first, decentralized synchronization and storage.

Askrella DChat allows users to create their own chat rooms and invite others to join. All messages sent and received in the chat room are encrypted using AES and can only be decrypted by the intended recipient.

The application is designed to be highly secure and private, with no central server storing any user data. Instead, all data is transmitted directly between users and the encryption keys are generated and managed locally on each userâ€™s device.
